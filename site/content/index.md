This app does everything you could possibly want it to do and not only that, it is beautifully designed and extremely intuitive to use. Download it from the App Store for FREE if you don’t mind some adverts popping up or if you prefer an ad-free experience then you can down load the ad-free version for 99p.

Whatever your budget and whatever the size of car you are looking for, we are sure we can help you find what’s right for you. We sell new and used cars from Pollos to Porchas. To fully appreciate the range of cars we have on offer please visit one of our showrooms.

We serve freshly brewed tea and coffee, soft drinks and a section of light meals and tasty treats and snacks. We are open for breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea from 8am to 5pm and unlike any other cafe in the town, we are open 7 days per week.
 
A truly family run business, we aim to create a cosy and friendly atmosphere in the cafe with Mum and Auntie doing the cooking and Dad and the (grown-up) children serving front of house. We look forward to welcoming you to the Cafe on the Corner very soon.

We offer NHS dental treatment to children and have a very easy private payment scheme for our adult patients. We encourage everyone to visit the dentist regularly so that we can prevent any problems from occurring and the more you visit the less likely it is that we will have to do anything “scary”!
